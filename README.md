📌 Overview

LUMINA is a custom-built smart night lamp designed to offer a healthier and more natural wake-up experience. Instead of using sudden loud sounds like traditional alarms, LUMINA gradually increases its brightness to simulate a sunrise, allowing the user to wake up calmly and gently. The lamp can also function as a regular night light and a party/decoration light, making it a multifunctional lighting device suitable for any environment.

This project integrates both hardware and software components. The heart of the system is an ESP32-S2 microcontroller, which not only controls the LEDs but also acts as a web server. Users can configure all lamp settings—including brightness, colors, alarm schedule, and party mode—directly through a built-in web interface without installing any external applications.
